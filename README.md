# TranslatLy — AI Translator (PWA)

![TranslatLy cover](assets/cover_translatLy.png)

TranslatLy is a web-based AI translator that works like a native app.  
It was built as a personal project to practice backend development, API design, and real-world architecture.

## 🧠 How it works (high-level)

- AI model performs the translation
- Result is returned to the user

The project focuses on stability, cost optimization, and real backend logic rather than simple API wrappers.
